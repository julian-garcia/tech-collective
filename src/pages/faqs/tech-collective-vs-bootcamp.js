                <p>Tech Collective is built on two pillars of educational research:</p>
                <div className="list" style={{paddingBottom:'0'}}>
                  <FaDotCircle /><p>Spaced repetition: learning is demonstrably more effective if it is spread out over a larger time period; and</p>
                  <FaDotCircle /><p>Cognitive load: thinking and learning is less effective if we are overloaded with information.</p>
                </div>
              </td>
              <td>
                <p>Traditional bootcamps are oriented entirely against both the spaced repetition and cognitive load theory of educational research: in a bootcamp, you are overwhelmed with dense information in a very short period of time, and expected to digest it all.</p>
                <p>(If you are interested in understanding why they might do this even if it's less effective, read our article: 3 ways in which the traditional bootcamp model is broken)</p>

                <p>50% of Tech Collective membership revenues are shared amongst the community of members.</p>
                <p>We think this a fairer distribution of revenues, since you and your peers provide the bulk of the value to each other.</p>

                <p>Yes. Part of the application process will involve looking at, and researching, the open-source materials we'll be using, so that you can make an informed decision.</p>
              </td>
              <td>
                <p>Probably not. It's certainly possible that this bootcamp has developed better resources than the open-source materials maintained by thousands of people passionate about developer education - but you'll have to take that on trust.</p>
