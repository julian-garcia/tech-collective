You will then be tasked to use this learning to build a chatbot which represents you and your application to Tech Collective, answering questions like: what interests you about Tech Collective? What do you look for in a peer? etc.</p>
              <p><strong>Purpose for us:</strong> This is to examine both how you apply your learning practically as well as gain insight into your motivations for joining Tech Collective, so that we can judge whether you could be a strong fit.</p>
              <p><strong>Purpose for you:</strong> You will learn to code something concrete, following an example of the pre-recorded tutorials you will receive on the programme. This will help you to understand whether you enjoy coding and whether you can learn effectively on our programme. Do you find it an enjoyable or productive use of your time?</p>
              <p>(Maximum transparency: you should expect no more than 1-2 hours of video instruction a week. It is not intended to be the primary source of your learning.)</p>

              <p><strong>Purpose for you:</strong> Pair programming will be a mandatory part of the programme. Is it something that you can see value coming from? Are you comfortable with the feedback experience?</p>

      <h2 className="heading" style={{marginTop:'-1.5rem'}}>Why are there so many stages in the application process?</h2>
      <p>We have multiple stages for benefit of all of the following:</p>
      <div className="list" style={{paddingBottom:'0.5rem'}}>
        <FaDotCircle /><p><strong>Yourself:</strong> we want you to know what you're committing to</p>
        <FaDotCircle /><p><strong>Your peers:</strong> we want every cohort to form an effective learning community</p>
        <FaDotCircle /><p><strong>Tech Collective:</strong> we want to minimise dropouts and maximise outcomes</p>
      </div>
      <h3 className="heading">For yourself</h3>
      <p>We want you to know what you're committing to. At 10 hours a week, for 12 months, Tech Collective is a serious commitment. It's important that you be able to make an informed decision about this commitment. That's why we have a lengthy application process to try to give you a good sense of:</p>
      <div className="list" style={{paddingBottom:'0.5rem'}}>
        <FaDotCircle /><p>what will I be learning?</p>
        <FaDotCircle /><p>who will I be learning with?</p>
        <FaDotCircle /><p>is this a manageable commitment?</p>
      </div>
      <p>(If you are finding the application process too onerous, then you might not have enough time right now to commit to Tech Collective.)</p>
      <h3 className="heading">For your peers</h3>
      <p>We want every cohort to form an effective learning community. Because of our peer-driven learning model, it is <strong>critically important</strong> that we have a thorough and rigorous application process. We would be failing our members if we did not surround them with people who have the right commitment, values and attitude.</p>
      <p>That's why we have a lengthy application process where you get to meet your prospective peers, and they get to meet you, to ensure that the cohorts we admit have the best possible odds of forming an effective learning community.</p>
      <h3 className="heading">For Tech Collective</h3>
      <p>We want to minimise dropouts and maximise outcomes. We don't make any money from you upfront. We only succeed if our members succeed. We only make money if:</p>
      <div className="list" style={{paddingBottom:'0.5rem'}}>
        <FaDotCircle /><p>admitted members commit seriously to Tech Collective; and</p>
        <FaDotCircle /><p>every cohort forms an effective learning community.</p>
      </div>
      <p>That's why it's in <strong>your</strong> interest, your <strong>peers'</strong> interest, <strong>and our</strong> interest for there to be a rigorous application process with multiple stages.</p>
